# Installation
This simple python program requires one additional dependency (others are usually present in a standard python environment). To install, just run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
For un-built version:

    python hourlyReminder.py

For built version (Only for Windows users ðŸ˜…):

Just run **hourlyReminder.exe**. You can minimize the app (it'll run in the background)


# Recommended
Install the "**Google Sans Medium**" Font. You can find it through a simple Google search. I can't link it here, as it might be against the policy.

# Good to know

 - You can add your own audio files to the "**audio**" directory, for a
   change of experience.
 - To change the time period delay, you'll need to change the source
   code (in **hourlyReminder.py**).

# Newbie/Lazy Tip
If you are a newbie or just lazy like me, you can download the pre-built version from the "**prebuilt-windows**" directory.
